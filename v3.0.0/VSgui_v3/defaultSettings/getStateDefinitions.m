% function states = getStateDefinitions
% here we define the meaning of the different states during trials used to advance 
% through our trial-based while loop (runTrials_XX).  
%
% These definitions were previously included in 'getDefaultSettings.m' but
% I moved them here for better readability of the code.
% This function is called by 'getDefaultSettings.m'.
% state definitions are stored in ex.states.XX
