% here we define the meaning of the strobe words that are being sent from
% datapixx to ripple
% DO NOT USE values 1 through 10000 (they are reserved to send digits such
% as trial IDs or trial numbers)
% note that bit 1 is also used for the reward. 
% Strobes are stored in ex.strobe.XX

% history
% 08/05/14  hn; wrote it
% 12/05/17  hn: added strobes for sleep on/off
% 08/15/25  hn: remove required input (ex): 'strobe = getStrobeDefinitions'
% 09/22/25  hn: defined OPTO_PULSE, and strobe.REWARD
