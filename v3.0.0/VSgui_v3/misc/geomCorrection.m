function [outX,outY] = geomCorrection(x,y,exSetup)
% Geometry correction
% Applies the screen warping calibration to pairs of x and y inputs. Useful
% for plotting visual elements to the screen that aren't plotted in the 
% main window and thus don't have the geometry correction automatically 
% applied, eg elements in the overlay window.
%
% INPUTS:
% x, vector of x coordinates in native pixels
% y, vector of y coordinates in native pixels, must be same length as x
% exSetup, input ex.setup from VSGui startup
%
% OUTPUTS:
% outX, x coordinates geometrically corrected (eg warped for the dome)
% outY, y coordinates geometrically corrected
